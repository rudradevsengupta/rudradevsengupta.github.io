<br> I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Interuniversity Institute for Biostatistics and statistical Bioinformatics (I-BioStat) and am working towards my Ph.D. thesis under the  supervision of <a href="https://www.uhasselt.be/fiche?email=ziv.shkedy">Professor Ziv Shkedy</a>.
<br>
<br> My primary field of research is statistical bioinformatics. I am more interested in application of statistical models and currently working on Microbiome data. I am also interested in the computational aspects of statistical models, data science, machine learning techniques and application of statistics in sports.
<br>
<br> Previously, I studied at the Indian Statistical 
<br> Institute, where I completed my Bachelor's degree 
<br> (in 2011), and Master's degree (in 2013) in Statistics.
